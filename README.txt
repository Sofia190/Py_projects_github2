Magazine Editor


Virtual Magazine is an online application for storing and editing magazine articles. Recently, they decided to help their users with a new program called Magazine Editor. 

Inside this applicattion, articles are stored as lists, which can contain nouns, adjectives and verbs as strings, integers, floating point numbers and lists. Magazine Editor promises to give a helpful hand to the users of Virtual Magazine.

Below are some rubric examples from Virtual Magazine.


a = ""

b = ""

c = ""

d = ""


a, b, c, d = virtual spaces to store information, like rubrics from magazines


- inside Magazine Editor, we should be able to navigate to a rubric


- we should be able to update rubrics and check if we reached the max number of words per article


- since a, b, c, d contain different types of info, we should gather all info of one type and store it in separate containers, that can be accesed by rubric name


- based on the data type that is stored in each container, Magazine Editor should make recomendations on what operation we should perform on that data


- we should be able to count items of each data type from a rubric


- it would be very useful to count all words stored inside a rubric


- everytime we want to know more info about how to use a word, Magazine Editor should return to us words related to the one that we choose
